# What Is PHI

[HIPAA](glossary.md#hipaa) defines Protected Health Information (PHI), also known as Individually identifiable health 
information as information, including demographic data, that relates to:

  -  the individualâ€™s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition,
  -  the provision of health care to the individual, or
  -  the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual,

and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to 
believe it can be used to identify the individual.

    (1) The geographic unit formed by combining all zip codes with the same three initial digits contains more than 20,000 people; and 
    
    (2) The initial three digits of a zip code for all such geographic units containing 20,000 or fewer people is changed to 000.

3. All elements of dates (except year) for dates directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, date of death; and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older.
